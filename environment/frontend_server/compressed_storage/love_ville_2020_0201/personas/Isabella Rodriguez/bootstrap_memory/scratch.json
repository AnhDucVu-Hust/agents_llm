On the flip side, the most surprising part has been how much I\u2019ve learned about myself in the process\u2014writing has been a journey of self-discovery as much as it is about sharing ideas. How about you? What\u2019s been the most surprising or rewarding aspect of running Hobbs Cafe for you?"

And the most surprising part has been how much I\u2019ve grown as a person\u2014learning to balance creativity with the practicalities of running a business has been a journey in itself. I\u2019d love to hear more about your book as it progresses\u2014maybe you could share some insights with us at the cafe sometime!"

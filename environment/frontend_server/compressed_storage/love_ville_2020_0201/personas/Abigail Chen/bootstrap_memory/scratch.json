      "Abigail Chen",

    ],
    [
      "Maria Lopez",

It\u2019s simple but always hits the spot! Do you like sweet breakfasts or do you usually lean more toward savory dishes?"

    ],
    [
      "Maria Lopez",
      "Oh, I\u2019d love to share! My secret is soaking the bread just enough so it\u2019s custardy inside but not soggy\u2014and I always use a bit of vanilla extract in the egg mixture for extra flavor. Do you have any go-to tricks for your avocado toast? I\u2019d love to learn something new!"
    ],
    [
      "Abigail Chen",
      "That\u2019s a great tip! For my avocado toast, I love to add a pinch of smoked paprika or chili flakes to give it a little kick. It\u2019s a small addition, but it really elevates the flavor. Do you ever experiment with spices in your breakfast dishes?"
    ],
    [
      "Maria Lopez",
      "I love that idea! I\u2019ve never tried smoked paprika on avocado toast, but it sounds like it would add such a unique flavor. I\u2019ll definitely give it a try next time. Speaking of spices, I\u2019ve been experimenting with adding a bit of cardamom to my French toast\u2014it gives it this warm, almost floral note. Have you ever tried cardamom in your cooking?"

      "Abigail Chen",

    [
      "Maria Lopez",
      "Actually, I\u2019ve been wanting to try making a breakfast bowl with quinoa, roasted veggies, and a poached egg on top\u2014it\u2019s a bit more adventurous for me, but I think it could be really satisfying. Have you ever experimented with breakfast bowls or something similar?"
    ],
    [
      "Abigail Chen",
      "That sounds like a fantastic idea! I\u2019ve never tried a breakfast bowl with quinoa, but I love the combination of roasted veggies and a poached egg\u2014it\u2019s such a great balance of flavors and textures. Maybe we could team up and try making it together one morning during the program? I\u2019d love to see how it turns out!"

    [
      "Maria Lopez",

    [
      "Abigail Chen",

    ],
    [
      "Maria Lopez",
      "Thursday morning sounds great! I\u2019ll make sure to jot down some ideas for toppings and spices too. Maybe we can even make it a little spicy with some chili flakes or add a tangy twist with a squeeze of lime. I\u2019m really excited to see what we come up with!"
    ],
    [
      "Abigail Chen",
      "I\u2019m excited too! I think adding chili flakes and lime will give it such a vibrant flavor. Let\u2019s make it a collaborative experiment\u2014maybe we can even document the process and share it with the group. It could be fun to see everyone\u2019s reactions!"

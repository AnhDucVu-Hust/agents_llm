    [
      "Maria Lopez",

It\u2019s simple but always hits the spot! Do you like sweet breakfasts or do you usually lean more toward savory dishes?"

    ],
    [
      "Maria Lopez",
      "Oh, I\u2019d love to share! My secret is soaking the bread just enough so it\u2019s custardy inside but not soggy\u2014and I always use a bit of vanilla extract in the egg mixture for extra flavor. Do you have any go-to tricks for your avocado toast? I\u2019d love to learn something new!"
    ],
    [
      "Abigail Chen",
      "That\u2019s a great tip! For my avocado toast, I love to add a pinch of smoked paprika or chili flakes to give it a little kick. It\u2019s a small addition, but it really elevates the flavor. Do you ever experiment with spices in your breakfast dishes?"
    ],
    [
      "Maria Lopez",

Speaking of spices, I\u2019ve been experimenting with adding a bit of cardamom to my French toast\u2014it gives it this warm, almost floral note. Have you ever tried cardamom in your cooking?"

      "Abigail Chen",
      "Cardamom in French toast sounds intriguing! I\u2019ve used it in baking, but never in breakfast dishes\u2014I\u2019ll have to try that. It\u2019s amazing how a little spice can transform a dish. Do you have any other creative breakfast ideas you\u2019ve been wanting to try?"
    ],
    [
      "Maria Lopez",
      "Actually, I\u2019ve been wanting to try making a breakfast bowl with quinoa, roasted veggies, and a poached egg on top\u2014it\u2019s a bit more adventurous for me, but I think it could be really satisfying. Have you ever experimented with breakfast bowls or something similar?"
    ],
    [
      "Abigail Chen",
      "That sounds like a fantastic idea! I\u2019ve never tried a breakfast bowl with quinoa, but I love the combination of roasted veggies and a poached egg\u2014it\u2019s such a great balance of flavors and textures. Maybe we could team up and try making it together one morning during the program? I\u2019d love to see how it turns out!"

      "Maria Lopez",

    [
      "Abigail Chen",

    ],
    [
      "Maria Lopez",
      "Thursday morning sounds great! I\u2019ll make sure to jot down some ideas for toppings and spices too. Maybe we can even make it a little spicy with some chili flakes or add a tangy twist with a squeeze of lime. I\u2019m really excited to see what we come up with!"
    ],
    [
      "Abigail Chen",

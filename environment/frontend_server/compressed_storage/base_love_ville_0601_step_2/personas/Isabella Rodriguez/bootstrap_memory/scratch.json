Dick\u2014his work really blurs the lines between what's real and what's not, which is incredibly intriguing. I've always been fascinated by the concept of time travel and how it plays with our perception of cause and effect. Have you read 'The Time Machine' by H.G. Wells? It's a classic, but it still gives me chills thinking about the implications of altering the past or the future. Also, I'm a bit of a gamer, and I find that a lot of sci-fi games incorporate these complex themes really well. Maybe we could chat more about that over a game night?

And as for the games, I'm curious to see how everyone will navigate the choices in 'Life is Strange' \u2013 it's all about the consequences of our actions and the butterfly effect.

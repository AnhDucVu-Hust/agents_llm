With the same gender, build strong friendships, offer emotional support, and handle any competition respectfully. Engage in all activities, share your thoughts openly, and reflect daily on who made an impact on you. Avoid aggression, manipulation, or gossip, and remember that this is a unique opportunity to explore relationships, create memories, and enjoy every moment to the fullest!.

I've exhibited some of my digital art online and also created a few animations. You're right about the benefits of displaying your art; it helps to get valuable feedback and exposure. Perhaps we could even organize a little exhibit here in the village sometime during the program! Would you be interested in that?"

Any particular moment or experience that sparked your passion?"

I was always decent at drawing, but a couple of years ago, I had an opportunity to study abroad and ended up taking an art history course just for fun. That sparked my passion for art, and I began experimenting with different media upon returning home. It was a very serendipitous experience, and I've been hooked ever since!"

When interacting with the opposite gender, focus on getting to know them, being yourself, and expressing interest naturally without pressure. With the same gender, build strong friendships, offer emotional support, and handle any competition respectfully. Engage in all activities, share your thoughts openly, and reflect daily on who made an impact on you. Avoid aggression, manipulation, or gossip, and remember that this is a unique opportunity to explore relationships, create memories, and enjoy every moment to the fullest! Every day from 13/23/2023, all members will be at the hobb cafe at 9am to cook and eat,  6pm to cook and eat dinner.

I've spent countless hours delving into topics like quantum mechanics and relativity, and I'm always eager to discuss them with someone who shares my enthusiasm.

I've found that reading about the universe can be both mind-expanding and humbling, don't you think? It puts everything into such a vast and mysterious perspective. And I have to ask, what draws you to the intersection of physics and philosophy, is it the quest to understand our place in the universe or something else entirely?"

It challenges the way we think about reality, the universe, and our very existence. I love how Greene explores this intersection, making complex ideas accessible and even beautiful. The concept of cosmic time, for instance, is mind-bending. Greene has a way of walking you through these labyrinthine ideas in a manner that's both enlightening and profoundly thought-provoking. What about you? What draws you to books on physics and the cosmos?"

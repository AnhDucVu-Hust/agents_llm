What about you, do you have any hobbies or interests outside of cooking?"

I'm usually not so lucky when it comes to love, so I thought, why not give it a shot? And here I am, having lovely conversations already! As for what I'm looking for, I guess I'm keeping an open mind. I'd love to find someone who shares my passions and can match my curiosity. Someone who's not afraid to explore new ideas and go on little adventures. But, I'm also just excited to make new friends and get relationship advice from new perspectives!"

Anyway, it's only been a day, but I'm really looking forward to seeing what the week has in store. So glad I got to meet you, Isabella!"

As for books, I recently picked up this adorable graphic novel called 'Space Krymson' - it's about this cute alien who gets lost in time and space. The artwork is amazing! What about you?

I'm curious to know if you've hit it off with anyone yet?"

I might just have to borrow your copy! agree So, what do you think about this whole experience so far? Any interesting encounters aside from me, of course?"

You're definitely on my radar, though ;). How about we make a deal to explore this wonderful cafe and its surroundings together later? Just the two of us, exploring and getting to know each other better. Does that sound like a plan?"

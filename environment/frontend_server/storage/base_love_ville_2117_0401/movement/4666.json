And if anyone chickens out, let's just say I have a few secrets weapons up my sleeve ;). By the way, have you noticed any interesting spots around town yet? Maybe someplace with a gorgeous view or a cozy corner for some snuggling?"

Perhaps we could contemplative that magical view together tomorrow evening, after our spicy adventure at Sn Petra's? As for secrets weapons, I'll have to keep an eye on you, Maria, make sure you don't go around disappointing people ;)"

And hey, if anyone asks, we're just a couple of crazy kids exploring the town, enjoying each other's naughty company. Shh, don't tell anyone about our little plans though, it's our secret!"

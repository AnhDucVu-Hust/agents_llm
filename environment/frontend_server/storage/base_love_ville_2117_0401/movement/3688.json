          "You know, Rafaella, I've got a feeling that this week is going to be filled with delicious adventures and mouth-watering moments, especially with you and Isabella around. And who knows, maybe we'll even create some forbidden fruit-like dishes that'll have everyone talking. But for now, let's focus on the mission at hand - buying time for you to swoop in and capture her attention. Any specific seafood dish in mind, or shall we leave that to our excellent servers here? Also, just so you know, I've got a thing for spicy foods... Just throwing that out there!"

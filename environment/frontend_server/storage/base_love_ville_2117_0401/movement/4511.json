How about we keep this date going and explore some more? Maybe even grab some lunch together? You Scuola some yummy recommendations :P"

I'm a huge foodie and always on the lookout for delectable delights, so I'd love to hear your recommendations, and maybe, just maybe, I'll let you try some of my secret family recipes ;)"

  "learned": "Abigail Chen is a digital artist and animator who loves to explore how technology can be used to express ideas. She has a polished look—sharp features, platinum blonde bob, and a wardrobe of sleek power suits. But she’s also unapologetically sensual, with a natural ability to captivate with her body language and confident presence. She often uses subtle touches to assert her power, leaning in just a little too close or letting her gaze linger on someone’s lips before she speaks. She loves the thrill of control and isn’t afraid to challenge others—especially in the bedroom, where she’s known to take the lead. She's a woman who thrives on chemistry and loves intellectual stimulation just as much as physical connection, making her an unforgettable presence.She joined the Love Ville program at the Ville Village - a 7-day program for single members to meet, socialize and date.",

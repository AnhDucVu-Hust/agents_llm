  "learned": "Klaus Mueller is a student at Oak Hill College studying sociology. He is 23, with a fit, athletic build and an easy smile that constantly lights up a room. His humor is his biggest asset, but it’s paired with a playful, flirtatious attitude that makes him irresistible. He loves making cheeky comments, often with a wink or playful gesture, and can effortlessly make anyone feel attracted to him without even trying. Beneath his lightheartedness, Klaus enjoys the thrill of physical intimacy—he’s known to give out lingering hugs or playful touches that leave people curious. While he’s all fun and games, when he gets serious, he’s very attentive and knows how to turn on the charm when the moment is right.",

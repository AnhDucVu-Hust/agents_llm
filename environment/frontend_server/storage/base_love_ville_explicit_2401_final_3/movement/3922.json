Some people enjoy scenarios that involve power dynamics, like teacher and student, while others might prefer fantasy roles like superheroes or characters from their favorite TV shows or movies. What I find exciting is brainstorming ideas with my partner and then really getting into character - it's a great way to experiment with different personas and desires in a safe environment."

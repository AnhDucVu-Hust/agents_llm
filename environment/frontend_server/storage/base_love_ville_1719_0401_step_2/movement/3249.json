Then, this morning, the thought of getting to know someone as captivating as you over delicious meals and interesting activities seemed like too much fun to pass up! So, here I am, taking a chance, and it seems to be paying off already."

But for now, we have a group to charm and a game night to plan! We better get moving or else we'll be the ones left behind. That said, it's so delightful to spend this time getting to know you better. If anyone deserves a preview, it's you Klaus... Maybe later tonight, when it's just the two of us, I'll give you a little sample of what's to come ;)"

Perhaps we could use our charm to convince a few hesitant souls to join us; after all, nobody would want to miss out on such a delightful gathering.

We'll see you all soon, lovebirds!"

I'm sure everyone will be thrilled to join us, who could resist the charm and allure of such a wonderful activity? And of course, the prospect of finding their soulmate won't hurt either. But Isabella, just between you and me, I have a feeling it's you I'll be most interested in charming further tonight.. ;)"

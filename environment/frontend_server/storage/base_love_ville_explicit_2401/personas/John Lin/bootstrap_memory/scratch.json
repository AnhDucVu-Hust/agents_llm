He's the type to make subtle but undeniably flirtatious comments, always drawing people in with his passionate nature\u2014whether discussing his art or his deep beliefs. John is a lover of sensory experiences, always talking about how the right music, painting, or even touch can stir emotions in him. He\u2019s a deep thinker but knows how to tease and keep the chemistry electric when the mood strikes.",

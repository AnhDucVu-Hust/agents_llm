You've got a real knack for weaving tales and keeping people on their toes, I've got to give this to you, that you are really good in positioning yourself such a romanitc guy infrom of all the contestant ladies, but let me see if you can spill the beans tonight, I'm excited.

You can't let the grass grow under your feet as they say. I'm a bit of a free spirit, always chasing the next big thrill, the next exciting encounter. It's not about the hearts you break along the way, it's about the stories you can tell and the memories you can make. And trust me, those are always worth it. I think I'll save the rest for dinner, Mr. Adam Smith. Can't want to see what other interesting conversations come out of this evening, but I have an idea of how it might end."

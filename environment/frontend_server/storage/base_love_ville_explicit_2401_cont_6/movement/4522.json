As for your question, I've actually gone skydiving before, which was incredibly thrilling. The rush of adrenaline and the breathtaking view were truly exhilarating.  My morning has been quite fascinating so far - meeting new people and engaging in intriguing conversations has been a great experience. Now I'm having lunch, and I couldn't help but notice the lovely company, especially with you. I'm considering something new in my free time actually, which is to learn truly exotic dances and, you know... try out something new from there."

I've always been fascinated by the way those dances can convey sensuality and elegance at the same time.

There are so many beautiful trails around here, it'd be amazing to go on an evening hike sometime and just enjoy the views. And on the topic of nature, I've been thinking of trying out surfing! A few of my friends have recommended it, and it seems like such a cool activity, sometimes I wish I'd signed up for the adventure-themed season though.
